Lesson 29 (step 3) — what the world model buys you: proactive vs reactive
=========================================================================
A depth net or an RL policy is *reactive*: it steers away from an obstacle once
the obstacle is close *now*. A world model lets you be *proactive*: it predicts
that you are *about to* get close and steers early. That head-start is the whole
point of anticipation — and it is exactly the signal step 2's collision head
produces (P(too close within k steps) from the predicted latent).

This script isolates the *control* benefit of that look-ahead. Two controllers
fly the same obstacle course:
  * reactive  — veers when the current distance to a pillar < REACT_R
  * proactive — veers when the *predicted* distance over the next HORIZON < REACT_R

Because the proactive trigger fires ~HORIZON earlier, it opens a wider berth and
turns grazes into clean misses.

Honest note (same convention as Lesson 13's ground-truth fallback): here the
k-step look-ahead is the simulator's *privileged* future geometry, so the
comparison is deterministic and studies decision *timing* on its own. On a real
drone that look-ahead is not free — it is precisely what the nano world model
(train_world_model.py, collision AUC reported there, int8 < 512 KB) predicts from
vision alone. Swapping the privileged look-ahead for that head is the going-further.
